# 🚀 Multi-Modal GenAI Agent (Full-Stack AI Application)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Multi-Modal GenAI Agent** is a full-stack Generative AI application that can understand and respond to **text, image, and audio inputs** using modern AI models powered by **Hugging Face**.

The project demonstrates how **multi-modal AI systems (similar to ChatGPT)** work internally — but in a **simpler, open-source, and developer-friendly** way, making it ideal for learners and AI enthusiasts.

This application is designed for **learning, experimentation, and portfolio building** in the field of **Generative AI and Full-Stack AI Engineering**.
